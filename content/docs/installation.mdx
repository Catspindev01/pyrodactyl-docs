This comprehensive guide walks you through setting up Pyrodactyl using Docker, from scratch to a fully functional system.

# Migrating from Pterodactyl

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Docker)

<Callout type="warn">
Always make sure you take a backup of your Pterodactyl database and other relevant data.
</Callout>

If you already have Pterodactyl running in Docker, simply update your panel image in your docker-compose.yml file:

```diff
-image: ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
+image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
```

You can swap back whenever you'd like.

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native -> Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Docker expertise and basic system administration skills
- Consider [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install) for easier Docker management
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

### Pyrodactyl Installation
1. Create a new folder (e.g. pyrodactyl-panel) on your server in a safe location, and switch to it.
2. Download and configure the [docker-compose.example.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml)
3. Modify placeholder variables under x-common
4. Add port 443 if you aren't using a reverse proxy for HTTPS. Also set LE_EMAIL under panel in x-common to an email you have used for certbot.
5. Copy the following environment variables from your Pterodactyl .env to your docker-compose.yml:
   ```
   APP_KEY
   APP_URL
   DB_CONNECTION
   DB_HOST
   DB_PORT
   DB_DATABASE
   DB_USERNAME
   DB_PASSWORD
   HASHIDS_SALT
   HASHIDS_LENGTH (if it's not 8)
   ```

   The following are only applicable if email is set up:
   ```
   MAIL_MAILER
   MAIL_HOST
   MAIL_PORT
   MAIL_USERNAME
   MAIL_PASSWORD
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
   MAIL_FROM_NAME
   APP_SERVICE_AUTHOR
   MAIL_DRIVER
   ```

6. If your database is running on the same machine as your panel, set it to listen on the IP 172.17.0.1, and change the DB_HOST environment variable to 172.17.0.1.
7. Rename docker-compose.example.yml to docker-compose.yml
8. Run the following command to start the panel:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Your panel is now running! You can access it at the same URL as before, and use the same user accounts.

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native)

<Callout type="note">
The latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/) is required to be installed to migrate without Docker.
</Callout>

Simply follow the manual [Pterodactyl updating guide](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/updating.html).

However, on the Download the Update step, use these commands instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl.git /var/www/pterodactyl --depth=2
npm ci && npm run ship
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

<Callout type="note">
Windows is currently only supported for development purposes.
</Callout>

# Fresh Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Docker expertise and basic system administration skills
- Consider [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install) for easier Docker management
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

1. Download and configure the [docker-compose.example.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml)
   - Modify placeholder variables under x-common
   - Adjust exposed ports if needed

2. Create a new folder (e.g. pyrodactyl-panel) on your server in a safe location, and move or upload your edited compose file into it. Rename the file to docker-compose.yml

3. In terminal, cd into the directory, and run the following command to start the panel:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Run the command below, and go through its prompts to create an admin user:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
   ```

5. Check that the panel is accessible using the IP address or domain of your server

## Panel Configuration

1. Access the panel via your server's IP/domain and login to your previously created user
2. Navigate to admin panel (three dots menu → Admin)
3. Navigate to Locations, make a new location. It can have any name
4. Navigate to Nodes, create a new node
   - FQDN is the domain or IP address (if you're not using HTTPS) of the server you're going to use as a backend
   - You should make sure the daemon ports are free on your backend server

5. On the new node, go to the:
   - Configuration tab: Copy the contents to /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml on your backend server
   - Allocation tab: Add some allocations to use for your servers. The IP should be 0.0.0.0. If you want to show a different IP in the UI (e.g. a subdomain), add an alias. You can input a range of ports like 25565-26000

## Wings Installation

In addition to the Pyrodactyl panel, you'll need Pterodactyl Wings as a backend for your servers, which we will also use Docker for. You can have multiple Wings instances on different servers, but for now, we're setting up just one.

1. Run the commands below to setup the compose for Wings:
   ```bash
   mkdir pyrodactyl-wings && cd pyrodactyl-wings
   wget https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/raw/develop/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Run the following command to start Wings:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify Wings status:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep wings
   ```

4. If applicable, allow wings in your firewall:
   - ufw:
     - ```bash
       ufw allow 2022
       ufw allow 8080
       ```

## Post-Installation Steps

### Email Configuration
For user password reset emails, etc, you'll need an SFTP server. For this, you can use:
- [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- [Mailersend](https://www.mailersend.com/)

Configure in Admin Panel → Settings

### DDoS protection
If you're planning to have your server publicly accessible, your server could be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Although not covered here due to its complexity, consider using:
- [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
- [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/)

The goal is to not have your server's IP address on any of your known domains.

## Troubleshooting
If issues arise:
1. Test with vanilla Pterodactyl by changing panel image to ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
2. Debug issues
3. Switch back to Pyrodactyl image when resolved
