title: Migrating from other panels
description: A comprehensive guide for migrating to Pyrodactyl from other game panels
---

This comprehensive guide walks you through migrating to Pyrodactyl, whether you use Docker or run your panel natively.

<Callout type="info">
For Pyrodactyl-specific issues, please use [Pyrodactyl GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/discussions) instead of Pterodactyl or Pelican support channels.
</Callout>

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Docker)

<Callout type="warn">
Always make sure you take a backup of your Pterodactyl database and other relevant data.
</Callout>

If you already have Pterodactyl running in Docker, simply update your panel image in your docker-compose.yml file:

```diff
-image: ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
+image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
```

<Callout type="warn">
Swapping between Pyrodactyl and Pterodactyl is unsupported and can cause data loss. Pyrodactyl makes changes to the database schema, making it unlikely Pterodactyl will function correctly. If you care about the validity of your database, **make a backup** before swapping back to Pterodactyl.
</Callout>

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native -> Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Docker expertise and basic system administration skills
- Consider [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install) for easier Docker management
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

### Pyrodactyl Installation
1. Create a new folder (e.g. pyrodactyl-panel) on your server in a safe location, and switch to it.
2. Download and configure the [docker-compose.example.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml)
3. Modify placeholder variables under x-common
4. If you are using builtin HTTPS, add port 443 (to the `ports` section under the `panel` container) and set the LE_EMAIL variable (in the `panel` section under `x-common`) to a registered Let's Encrypt email address.
5. Copy the following environment variables from your Pterodactyl .env to your docker-compose.yml:
   ```
   APP_KEY
   APP_URL
   DB_CONNECTION
   DB_HOST
   DB_PORT
   DB_DATABASE
   DB_USERNAME
   DB_PASSWORD
   HASHIDS_SALT
   HASHIDS_LENGTH (if it's not 8)
   ```

   The following are only applicable if email is set up:
   ```
   MAIL_MAILER
   MAIL_HOST
   MAIL_PORT
   MAIL_USERNAME
   MAIL_PASSWORD
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
   MAIL_FROM_NAME
   APP_SERVICE_AUTHOR
   MAIL_DRIVER
   ```

6. If your database is running on the same machine as your panel, set it to listen on the IP 172.17.0.1, and change the DB_HOST environment variable to 172.17.0.1.
7. Rename docker-compose.example.yml to docker-compose.yml
8. Run the following command to start the panel:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Your panel is now running! You can access it at the same URL as before, and use the same user accounts.

## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native)

<Callout type="note">
The latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/) is required to be installed to migrate without Docker.
</Callout>

Simply follow the manual [Pterodactyl updating guide](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/updating.html).

However, on the Download the Update step, use these commands instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl.git /var/www/pterodactyl --depth=2
npm ci && npm run ship
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```
